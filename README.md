# odin-recipes

This is the first project in The Odin Project's curriculum. It is a simple website containing recipes. 

Currently, it only uses HTML and does not use CSS. However, the curriculum states that the project will be revisited in the future and will be styled using CSS.

Once I have completed this project, I will have demonstrated several skills:

 - Creating HTML boilerplate
 - Using basic HTML elements and attributes
 - Using (terminal) commands
 - Using Git commands and GitHub
 - Making atomic commits
 - Writing effective commit messages
